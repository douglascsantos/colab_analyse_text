We calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) using Swiss population cancer incidence data, and cumulative incidence of SPNs. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) of risk factors for SPNs using Fine and Gray competing risk regression., Among 8074 childhood cancer patients, 304 (4%) were diagnosed with a CPS and 94 (1%) developed early SPNs. The incidence of SPNs was more than 10-fold higher in childhood cancer patients than the incidence of neoplasms in the general population (SIR = 10.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-13.1) and the AER was 179/100,000 person-years (CI: 139-219). Cumulative incidence of SPNs 20 years after FPN diagnosis was 23% in patients with CPSs (CI: 12-41%) and 2.7% in those without (CI: 2.0-3.6%).

The dynamic radiotherapy-associated risks (RR) for cancer of the uterine corpus significantly increased with increasing age at rectal cancer diagnosis (aged 20-49 years: adjusted RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.35-1.79; P\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.57; aged 50-69 years: adjusted RR, 3.74; 95% CI, 2.63-5.32; P\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001; aged ≥70 years: adjusted RR, 5.13; 95% CI, 2.64-9.97; P\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001) and decreased with increasing latency since rectal cancer diagnosis (60-119 months: adjusted RR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.12-4.87; P\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001; 120-239 months: adjusted RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.75-4.24; P\\\\u2009<\\\\u2009.001; 240-360 months: adjusted RR, 1.95; 95% CI, 0.67-5.66; P\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.22), but the dynamic RR for ovarian cancer increased with increasing latency since rectal cancer diagnosis (60-119 months: adjusted RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.26-1.89; P\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.48; 120-239 months: adjusted RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.09-4.70; P\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.03; 240-360 months: adjusted RR, 11.84; 95% CI, 2.18-64.33; P\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.004). The 10-year overall survival among patients with radiotherapy-associated cancer of the uterine corpus was significantly lower than that among matched patients with primary cancer of the uterine corpus (21.5% vs 33.6%; P\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009.01)., Radiotherapy for rectal cancer was associated with an increased risk of cancer of the uterine corpus and ovarian cancer.

The preparation of these guidelines showed a paucity of high-quality evidence and highlighted the need for additional research to inform survivorship care. The recommendations are based on careful consideration of the evidence supporting the benefits, risks, and harms of the surveillance interventions, clinical judgment regarding individual patient circumstances, and the need to maintain flexibility of application across different health-care systems. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to establish whether early detection of subsequent CNS neoplasms reduces morbidity and mortality, and therefore no recommendation can be formulated for or against routine MRI surveillance.

Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs. However, for any given therapeutic exposure, the risk of developing an SMN varies between individuals. Genomic variation can potentially modify the association between therapeutic exposures and SMN risk and may explain the observed interindividual variability. In this review, the author provides a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of genomic variation in the development of therapy-related SMNs and discusses the methodological challenges in undertaking an endeavor to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, such as an appropriate study design, the identification of an adequately sized study population together with a reliable plan for collecting and maintaining high-quality DNA, clinical validation of the phenotype, and the selection of an appropriate approach or platform for genotyping. Understanding the factors that can modify the risk of treatment-related SMNs is critical to developing targeted intervention strategies and optimizing risk-based health care for cancer survivors.', 'Language': 'eng', 'Keyword': 'cancer survivors, gene-environment interactions, genetic susceptibility, second cancers, therapeutic exposures'}\n",

An actual, simple and flexible solution.', 'AbstractText': 'Pathology laboratories are one of the main information sources for cancer registries and have traditionally been coded with SNOMED; some of them are migrating to SNOMED CT (SCT). Cancer registries encode topography and morphology of neoplasms by the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). ICD-O updates morphology with WHO Classification of Tumors (Blue-Books). Morphological codes of the ICD-O, Blue-Books and SNOMED (former SNOMEDID) have always coincided. In 2017, SCT removed the SNOMEDID., to define neoplastic and topographic subsets in SCT and map them to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books; reduce the original number of SCT concepts; correctly identify neoplasms in the laboratories in accordance with international cancer registry rules., SCT neoplastic concepts were identified by manual revision and SCT resources (\"is a\", \"Associated morphology\" relationships; Simple Map Reference Set). Topographic concepts were extracted from the body structure hierarchy of SCT. Both subsets were mapped to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books, afterwards. Updating algorithms were designed to automate and update each subset with every SCT release. The process of neoplasms identification was validated in a sample of 5212 specimens with 7378 records from 8 Catalan hospitals., The number of concepts in neoplastic and topographic subsets (16,448 and 32,278) was reduced after the mapping to ICD-O-3.1/Blue-Books (2115 and 330, respectively). Neoplastic subset classified the specimens correctly in the 98.6% of the specimens., \"This article presents a flexible tool to exhaustively identify neoplasms in pathology laboratories that code with SCT, following international PBCRs standards and in line with the pathologists, oncologists and epidemiologists needs.\"', 'Language': 'eng', 'Keyword': 'Cancer registry, ICD-O-3.1, Neoplasm, Pathology, SNOMED CT, WHO Blue Books'}\n",

We assessed the contribution of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in cancer predisposition genes to their SN risk. Patients and Methods Whole-genome sequencing (30-fold) was performed on samples from childhood cancer survivors who were ≥ 5 years since initial cancer diagnosis and participants in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Germline mutations in 60 genes known to be associated with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes with moderate to high penetrance were classified by their pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Relative rates (RRs) and 95% CIs of SN occurrence by mutation status were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential regression stratified by radiation exposure. Results Participants were 3,006 survivors (53% male; median age, 35.8 years [range, 7.1 to 69.8 years]; 56% received radiotherapy), 1,120 SNs were diagnosed among 439 survivors (14.6%), and 175 P/LP mutations were identified in 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0% to 6.7%) of survivors. Mutations were associated with significantly increased rates of breast cancer (RR, 13.9; 95% CI, 6.0 to 32.2) and sarcoma (RR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.3 to 26.3) among irradiated survivors and with increased rates of developing any SN (RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.3), breast cancer (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 24.4), nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR, 11.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 41.4), and two or more histologically distinct SNs (RR, 18.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 99.3) among nonirradiated survivors. Conclusion The findings support referral of all survivors for genetic counseling for potential clinical genetic testing, which should be prioritized for nonirradiated survivors with any SN and for those with breast cancer or sarcoma in the field of prior irradiation.', 'Language': 'eng', 'Keyword': ''}\n",

We investigated the risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA cancer., The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 200\\\\u2008945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15-39 years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16 types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female); Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital; leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per 10\\\\u2008000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer., During the 2\\\\u2008631\\\\u2008326 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16·8 years, IQR 10·5-25·2), 12\\\\u2008321 subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11\\\\u2008565 survivors, most frequently among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19·5 per 10\\\\u2008000 person-years (95% CI 17·4-21·5) in survivors of breast cancer, 10·2 (8·0-12·4) in survivors of cervical cancer, 18·9 (16·6-21·1) in survivors of testicular cancer, 55·7 (50·4-61·1) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29·9 (26·3-33·6) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11·9% (95% CI 11·3-12·6) in survivors of breast cancer, 15·8% (14·8-16·7) in survivors of cervical cancer, 20·2% (18·9-21·5) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26·6% (24·7-28·6) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16·5% (15·2-18·0) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated., Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer., Cancer Research UK, National Institute for Health Research, Academy of Medical Sciences, and Children with Cancer UK.', 'Language': 'eng', 'Keyword': ''}\n",

No longitudinal studies have assessed the long-term risk of other lymphoma or cancer overall. Here, we investigated the risk of lymphoid neoplasms and other cancer after malaria., We included 4125 patients diagnosed with malaria in Sweden in 1987-2015, identified either through the National Surveillance Database at the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the National Inpatient and Outpatient Register, or by reports from microbiology departments. A comparator cohort (N\\\\u2009=\\\\u200966,997) matched on sex, age and birth region was retrieved from the general population and an additional cohort with all individuals born in Sub-Saharan Africa registered in the Total Population Register in 1987-2015 (N\\\\u2009=\\\\u2009171,756). Incident lymphomas and other cancers were identified through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. Hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed using Cox regression with attained age as the timescale., A total of 20 lymphoid neoplasms and 202 non-haematological cancers were identified among malaria patients during a mean follow-up of 13.3 and 13.7\\\\u2009years, respectively. The overall risk of lymphoid neoplasms was not significantly increased (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.94), neither did we find any association with all-site non-haematological cancer (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.02). However, in the Sub-Saharan Africa cohort, we observed an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms after malaria diagnosis (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.06-5.40), but no difference in the risk of other cancer (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.70-1.45). The association could not be explained by co-infection with HIV or chronic hepatitis B or C, since the risk estimate was largely unchanged after excluding patients with these comorbidities (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.08-6.42). The risk became more pronounced when restricting analyses to only including non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.42-8.56)., Individuals born in malaria-endemic areas and diagnosed with malaria in Sweden had an increased risk of lymphoid neoplasms, especially B cell lymphoma. There was no association with cancer overall nor did single malaria episodes confer an increased risk in travellers.', 'Language': 'eng', 'Keyword': 'Cancer, Lymphoid neoplasms, Lymphoma, Malaria'}\n",
